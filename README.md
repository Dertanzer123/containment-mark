## 📖 Overview

The **Prison Management System** is a modular and scalable desktop application developed to optimize the daily
operations of prison staff.
The system focuses on centralized prisoner and staff management, cell allocation, visitor tracking, and report
generation.
**PMS** aims to increase **security**, **efficiency**, and **productivity** of prison environments by transition from
manual systems to structured, secure digital processes.
